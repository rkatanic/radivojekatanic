### Info

We all need some kind of app for taking every day notes. This one is mine.
Based on markdown syntax, built for maximum simplicity and effectiveness.

Markdown is also popular among developers for writing project documentation, others use it for writing blogs.
Matter of fact, this whole page is written in markdown, which is processed by markdown extension and converted into styled HTML blocks.

App features file preview in more human readable format, download of notes in .md format, and saving of notes by persisting markdown syntax in local storage.
