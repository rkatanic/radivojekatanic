### Info

This creative tool is result of my explorations of HTML canvas.

Many people have spontaneous moments of creativity and want to capture their ideas quickly. Sometimes making a simple sketch is enough to capture certain idea that popped.

Some scientific researches shown that doodling can be a therapeutic and enjoyable activity.
I use this tool to relax and express myself creatively in leisure time.
