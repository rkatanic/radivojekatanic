### Blueprint UI

This component library is made out of need for consistent design in all of my tiny side-projects & experiments.
It's a collection of pre-built and reusable HTML blocks created using Tailwind's utility classes.

It eliminates the need to recreate common UI elements from scratch every time, yet leaving a space to add specific functionalities and interactions tailored to different application's requirements.

I started this project as an opportunity to learn more about utility-first CSS. Now it's hard to imagine myself working without it.
