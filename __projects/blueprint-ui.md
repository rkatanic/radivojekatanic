### Blueprint UI

Blueprint UI is design system made out of need for consistent design in all of my small projects & experiments.\
As name already reveals it's inspired by blueprint paper featuring 8px grid background and components with sharp edges inspired by technical drawings.

[IBM Plex Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans) is typeface choice for this design system.
