### Info

When building different web interfaces I often time struggle to find the right color palette. One thing I learned over time is that maintaining consistency in color choices is essential for building visually appealing user interfaces.

Presence of this app is a response to the demand and struggle of myself with seeking a practical and efficient way of working with color variations.

This tool is mostly based on HSL color specification, but also features HEX color values.
I find HSL approach much more readable and intuinitive to work with as of its straightforward color interpretation.

On every initial page load app generates new color palette.

It also features HEX to HSL converter and vice versa.
